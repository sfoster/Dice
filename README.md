# Dice: Poor man's browser-based dice

This is a quick prototype knocked up when my kids and I were playing a board games and couldn't find any dice in the house. It currently uses Dojo for the events and animations. 

The audio I recorded myself rattling some hazelnuts in a cup - turned out OK! I only have the .ogg format for now. It works for me in Firefox and Chrome, perhaps other browers too?
Likewise, the graphics are rough and ready. But you know, you can click the buttons and have the dice roll in a convincing enough way to satisfy a 7yr old, so it can't be that bad. 

## TODO

This is just a toy, but some improvements suggest themselves:

 * mp3 audio
 * CSS animation?
 * Nicer sprite sheet for the 6-sided die
 * Add has.js and implement audio feature detection
 * Build the dice nodes on the fly and some UI to pick how many (and how many sides)
 * Other-sided dice: get/create sprite sheets for 4, 8, 10, 20 sided die
 * Some mobile love: shake / touch-waggle to roll
