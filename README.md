# Dice: Poor man's browser-based dice

This is a quick prototype knocked up when my kids and I were playing a board games and couldn't find any dice in the house. It currently uses Dojo for the events and animations. 

The audio I recorded myself rattling some hazelnuts in a cup - turned out OK! I only have the .ogg format for now. It works for me in Firefox and Chrome, perhaps other browers too?
Likewise, the graphics are rough and ready. But you know, you can click the buttons and have the dice roll in a convincing enough way to satisfy a 7yr old, so it can't be that bad.
